#Task 1.3.4
# 1. Write a Python function, which Implements the Euler function.
# Euler function is return a count of numbers not great than N, which are mutually simple with N.
# Example  Ï†(6)=2, as only 1 and 5 from 1,2,3,4,5 are mutually simple with 6.

def gcd(a, b):
    while a != b:
        if a > b:
            a = a - b
        else:
            b = b - a
    return a


def Euler(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (gcd(i, n) == 1):
            count += 1
    return count

print(Euler(0))   #0
print(Euler(1))   #0
print(Euler(8))   #4



# 2.Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky

# 3.The robot is standing on a rectangular grid and is currently located at the point (X0, Y0).
# The coordinates are integers. It receives N remote commands(list with n elements each of them is a command).
# Each command is one of : up, down, left, right. Upon receiving a correct command, the robot moves one unit in the given direction.
# If the robot receives an incorrect command, it simply ignores it. Where will the robot be located after following all the commands?
#Write a python function, which returns the sum of digits of given number N.

# 4. Write a python function, which returns the sum of digits of given number N.

# 5.Write a python program to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified number. For example, for 119 next palindrome is 121.
